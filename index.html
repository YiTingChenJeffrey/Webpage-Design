            <p>Hello, my name is Yi Ting Chen. I am a graduate international student from Taiwan and currently study in University of Miami. I major in Interactive Media and probably going to choose game design as my concentration. Before I came to Miami for school, I was in California studying Business. California has much nicer weather than Miami. In California, there is not too much rain and the temperature is steadly around 75 degree fahrenheit. </p>
        <p>I am 22 years old right now. I have a younger brother in my family. His name is Wei Ting Chen. He starts his college life this year in University of Toronto. He decides to go there because the school is highly ranked in the world and a lot of his friends are going there. He is studying computer science over there.
        </p>
        <p> I love playing and watching basketball. My favourite basketball team is Golden State Warriors. They just won the 2015 world championship which makes me so happy  I also watch Major League Baseball game because one of the player in Baltimore Orioles is from Taiwan. His name is Wei Ying Chen.</p>
        <p>At home, I often sit in front of the table and play computer games. The most recently game I played is League of legends. This is now the most popular game in the world. The world champiopnship of this game is going to start on October 1st 2015 in Europe. I cannot wait to see Taiwanese team perform on stage.</p></div>
